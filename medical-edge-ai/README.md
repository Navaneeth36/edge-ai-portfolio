# Heart Failure Prediction System | Medical Edge AI

## Overview
Comparative analysis of Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest models for clinical edge deployment. Optimized Random Forest achieving 93% accuracy through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

## Key Achievements
- 93% accuracy with Random Forest
- 60% model size reduction for edge deployment
- Real-time inference via Dockerized web app

## Tech Stack
- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- SHAP for model interpretability
- Docker, Streamlit for deployment
